# MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
---
I started with creating a wireframe for my project using figma [Portfolio design](https://www.figma.com/file/2hMBCNNzKIqf9QaIdecJB1/My_Portifolio?node-id=10%3A96).

### The Design
---
Well coming up with the design wasn't that easy since figma was just a new tool but I'm glad that I pulled up such a beautifull design.

I still have some issue with choosing colors but I know experience is the best teacher, my mentors shared a number of resources to help me work on strengthening my color muscles.

Shoutouts to the [KANZUCODE TEAM](https://kanzucode.com/) and [CODE IMPACT TEAM](https://codeimpact.co/) for the support they render towards us most especially me as an individual.

### The Project
---
I started by creating a folder on my desktop followed by creating a repository on github. Then I linked up the two using git commands.
