# MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
---
I started with creating a wireframe for my project using figma [Portfolio design](https://www.figma.com/file/2hMBCNNzKIqf9QaIdecJB1/My_Portifolio?node-id=10%3A96).

### The Design
---
Well coming up with the design wasn't that easy since figma was just a new tool but I'm glad that I pulled up such a beautifull design.

I still have some issue with choosing colors but I know experience is the best teacher, my mentors shared a number of resources to help me work on strengthening my color muscles.

Shoutouts to the [KANZUCODE TEAM](https://kanzucode.com/) and [CODE IMPACT TEAM](https://codeimpact.co/) for the support they render towards us most especially me as an individual.

### The Project
---
I started by creating a folder on my desktop followed by creating a repository on github. Then I linked up the two using git commands.
I then started setting up the Project resources that I am to use, to smoothen my workload while writing the code.

#### Resources Include
- Images
- Html template
- Css variables
    ```
    :root {
    /*------Font-family------*/
    --logo_font:'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    --catch_txt:'Noto Serif JP', serif;
    --intro_txt:'Abhaya Libre', serif;
    --menu_txt:'Inter', sans-serif;
    --body_txt:'Poppins', sans-serif;
    /*------Colors------*/
    --bg_color:#A09B9B;
    --menu_color:#07070A;
    --light_black:#1E1E1E;
    --green_cal:#008B69;
    --pure_white:#ffffff;
    --pink_lady:#A41C6D;
    /*------font-size------*/
    --catch_sz:3rem;
    --body_sz:1.5rem;
    --intro_sz:2rem;
    --logo_sz:2.25rem;
  }
  ```
Then after setting up all the prerequisites, I believe I am now set to put my site to life.
#### Mobile Vesion

It was fun completing the mobile version. It was a journey full of bugs and errors but regardless, I had to get the work done.
It is always very nice to see yourself puting something to life, but I am a little bit confused on whether to break the rules "Ka little" because in the project they said you use things like js and jquery at your own risk yet I have to implement the humberger menu functionality. I feel like I gonna break some things.
